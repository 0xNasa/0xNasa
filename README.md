# Joe Josue

I build in ambiguity.

I work with founders, teams, and operators during 0 -> 1 moments:
new products, new business units, and hard transitions that need both speed and clarity.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of strategy and execution.
I care about first principles, clean systems, and shipping things that compound.

## Now

Right now I am focused on:

- Helping frontier-tech teams go from idea to operating rhythm
- Building practical systems for decision-making, GTM, and delivery
- Writing and thinking in public as I refine how I work

## Work

Over the years, I have operated across creative studios, startups, esports, and web3 ecosystems.
Usually as a founder, advisor, or embedded operator brought in when things need to move.

Selected highlights:

- Co-Founder / CEO, Metasports.gg (acquired, 2023)
- Founder, Djinn.App (acquired, 2024)
- Angel investor, Acadarena (seed, 2020)

## Philosophy

I believe good operating is simple:

- Name the real problem
- Reduce noise
- Ship the next correct thing
- Repeat with discipline
